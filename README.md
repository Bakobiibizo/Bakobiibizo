Hey, I’m Bako. I’m an AI and blockchain engineer focused on production-grade inference pipelines, backend APIs, MCP/RPC services, and distributed systems.

I work primarily in Rust and Python, with solid experience maintaining and shipping TypeScript projects, and I’m highly effective with Bash and deployment tooling. I’ve built and operated subnets on CommuneAI and Bittensor, and I’ve shipped smart contracts and infrastructure across Substrate, Ethereum, and Solana.

I’m also a co-founder of [Hydra-Dynamix](https://www.hydradynamix.com/) AI development company, where I focus on taking research and prototypes all the way to reliable production systems.

If you need an AI system deployed, scalable backend infrastructure, or a blockchain / smart-contract project launched properly, you can reach me at **@bakobiibizo**.
