Heya, Bako here. I am an AI and block chain developer specializing in inference pipelines, api's, mcp, and rpc clients and servers. I'm also well versed in substrate development and etherium and solana smart contracts. I'm a self taught developer that primarily works in rust and python but I can still find my way around a typescript project and I'm becoming a wizard with bash scripting. I've built subnets for CommuneAI and Bittensor and am the co-founder of an AI developement company. If you need an AI project brought to production or have a block chain or smart contract that needs to be launched feel free to fire me a line. @bakobiibizo everywhere.
