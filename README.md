Heya, Bako here. I am an AI and block chain developer specializing in inference pipelines and api's and substrate block chains. I'm a self taught developer that primarily works in python and rust but I can work well enough with typescript and go and I'm becoming a wizard with bash scripting. I've built subnets for CommuneAI and Bittensor and am working in the Developer's Academy for Olas building automated on chain agents. If you need an AI project online or a substrate validator miner pair for a subnet fire me a line. @bakobiibizo everywhere.
